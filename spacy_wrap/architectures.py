    tasks or applied as is.

    Args:
        name (str): Name of the Huggingface model to use.
        get_spans (Callable[[List[Doc]], List[List[Span]]]): A function to extract
            spans from the batch of Doc objects. See the "TransformerModel" layer
            for details.
        tokenizer_config (dict): Settings to pass to the transformers tokenizer.
        transformers_config (dict): Settings to pass to the transformers forward pass
            of the transformer.
        mixed_precision (bool): Enable mixed-precision. Mixed-precision replaces
            whitelisted ops to half-precision counterparts. This speeds up training
            and prediction on modern GPUs and reduces GPU memory use.
        grad_scaler_config (dict): Configuration for gradient scaling in mixed-precision
            training. Gradient scaling is enabled automatically when mixed-precision
            training is used.
            Setting `enabled` to `False` in the gradient scaling configuration disables
            gradient scaling. The `init_scale` (default: `2 ** 16`) determines the
            initial scale. `backoff_factor` (default: `0.5`) specifies the factor
            by which the scale should be reduced when gradients overflow.
            `growth_interval` (default: `2000`) configures the number of steps
            without gradient overflows after which the scale should be increased.
            Finally, `growth_factor` (default: `2.0`) determines the factor by which
            the scale should be increased when no overflows were found for
            `growth_interval` steps.
